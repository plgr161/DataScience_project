# DataScience_project
This code is a project realised with two students of my master program. The goal was to explore ML methods trying to solve a challenge data offered by QRT.
What we tried in this project is to make a comparison between Scikit-learn resolution methods to predict a quantity. 
Here is the exact statement of the project : https://challengedata.ens.fr/challenges/97
